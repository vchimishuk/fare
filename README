README
    fare is a pastebin-like files hosting web-service. It is oriented for
    shell usage (no web form to upload files and command line client out of
    the box).

INSTALL
    To install it on Debian/Ubuntu system you can build and install deb-package
    with next command.
    $ debuild
    # dpkg --install ../fare_1.0.0_all.deb
    The service can be configured with /etc/fare.conf configuration file and
    controlled with systemd.

USAGE
    The simplest and most convenient way to use the service is to use
    `tools/fare` tool from the current distribution. See `fare --help`
    for more details.

    To upload file or text snippet using raw HTTP API you can use:
    1. Use multipart/form-data HTTP POST request with `file` field containing
       file contents.
       Examples:
       $ curl -F file=@file.txt https://fare-server.address
       $ cat file.txt | curl -F file=@- https://fare-server.address
       $ wget -q -O - --header="Content-type: multipart/form-data boundary=FILEUPLOAD" \
         --post-file file.txt https://fare-server.address
    2. Use REST API -- send POST request with a file contents as a body.
       Optional request header `X-Filename` can be used to specify filename.
       Examples.
       $ curl -H "Content-Type: image/png" -H "X-Filename: image.png" \
         --data-binary @image.png https://fare-server.address
       $ wget -q -O - --header="Content-type: image/png" --header="X-Filename: image.png" \
         --post-file image.png https://fare-server.address

    There is also Emacs client interface for the service, which provides
    convenient way to post buffer or selected region. See `emacs/fare.el`
    file from the current distribution.
